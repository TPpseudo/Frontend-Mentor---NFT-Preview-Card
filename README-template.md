## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project allowed me to recap on the use of Flexbox, whilst also improving my use of pseudo-classes. This was my first encounter with a project requiring an optimalisation depending on screensize, so that was a great new experience.

### Continued development

Further development of the use of media queries is definitely required.
